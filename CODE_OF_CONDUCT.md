# Contributor Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and our community a welcoming, harassment-free experience for everyone. We are committed to promoting a friendly, inclusive, and safe environment for all, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contribute to creating a positive environment include:

- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Constructive feedback and thoughtful discussion
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by mistakes
- Focusing on what is best for the community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- Use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome advances
- Trolling, insulting, or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing othersâ€™ private information, such as physical or electronic addresses, without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct, and may ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for behaviors they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within project spaces and applies when an individual is representing the project or its community in public spaces. Examples of representing the project include using an official project email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at [your email address]. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All project team members are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.
